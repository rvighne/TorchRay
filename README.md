# TorchRay

TorchRay is a simple and performant raycasting engine that runs in the browser, using modern technologies like [ES7 JavaScript](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus/) and [HTML5 Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API). Its simple design and clean code (I hope :wink:) is ideal for learning how a raycasting engine works.
